It is an important access control policy that can significantly improve workflow flexibility. A crucial requirement after delegations is to check the satisfiability of workflow, i.e., determining whether there exists a valid execution schedule ($ES$) in the workflow that can ensure it to proceed from the beginning to the ending while satisfying all authorization constraints. Existing works perform in a centralized manner to find such a valid $ES$ by exploring all $ES$s. Unfortunately, the enumeration of $ES$s is highly inefficient from the perspective of computational complexity. This study proposes a novel approach to overcome this difficulty in a distributed way. First, we use Petri nets (PNs) to formalize workflow and user delegations. Then, we directly specify a conflict-free workflow that satisfies all authorization constraints. Hence, determining the satisfiability of a workflow amounts to directly checking the existence of $ES$s in the corresponding conflict-free workflow. Finally, we present a distributed strategy, which is of polynomial complexity, to determine the existence of $ES$s.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2023.3248602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10052704","Distributed control;petri nets;separation of duty constraint;user delegation;workflow processes","Authorization;Indexes;Contracts;Schedules;Petri nets;Computational complexity;Process control","","","","","","","IEEE","24 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

There are two typical security requirements, i.e., separation of duty (SoD) and binding of duty (BoD). However, most of the previous works are only focused on SoD while ignoring BoD. In this article, we consider both of them by proposing an extended-structural implementation approach, namely beacon-based firing control, to enforce security requirements. Thanks to the flexibility of beacon-based firing control, both BoD and SoD can be enforced in a straightforward way with no sophisticated operations for their implementation, although they are a pair of security requirements in conflict. As a preparation of beacon-based firing control, we define the beacon-extended Petri nets (PNs) by introducing a new object, namely beacon, to PNs so as to lay the foundation. In addition, we present the firing-based linear equations and inequalities for BoD and SoD to provide the standardized descriptions for their implementation. For the sake of expansibility, the applicability analysis is provided for the more general security requirements. Ultimately, the comparative experiments and discussions are presented to show the effiectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2023.3235785","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973242,61573265,61203037); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:K7215581201,K5051304004,K5051304021); New Century Excellent Talents in University(grant numbers:NCET-12-0921); Academic Research Fund Tier 1; Ministry of Education in Singapore(grant numbers:2014-T1-001-147); Academic Research Fund Tier 2; Ministry of Education in Singapore(grant numbers:MOE2015-T2-2-049); Major Fundamental Research Program of the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2017ZDJC-34); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040487","Authorization-related security;beacon-extended Petri nets (BEPNs);beacon-based firing control;workflows","Security;Authorization;Task analysis;Mathematical models;Business;Monitoring;Computational modeling","","","","","","","IEEE","7 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Checking the satisfiability of authorization constraints imposes a major challenge when the number of states of a target system is large. To overcome this difficulty, we provide three necessary and sufficient conditions to check three different constraints, namely Separation of Duties (SoDs), Binding of Duties (BoDs), and Constraints of Cardinality (CoCs). The proposed results are based on the solutions of integer linear programming problems (ILPs). By relying on an ILP formulation that does not require the explicit computation of the net reachability set, the proposed approach is particularly well suited for large-size PNs. When the given system does not satisfy a considered constraint, the objective is to propose a suitable violation resolution strategy to correctly enforce the given constraint. In this paper, enforcement of control places and administration of RBAC are presented to solve the SoD, BoD, and CoC violations. All violations can be corrected in a once for all manner while simultaneously ensuring the satisfaction of all other constraints.

Existing works usually adopt model checking to verify SoDs. However, building formal models that simultaneously account for both workflow and SoDs is a time-consuming and error-prone activity. In this article, we propose a new approach to specifying and enforcing SoDs in business processes using Petri nets (PNs). First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the SoD violations from the viewpoint of structure and marking of PNs. We show that the SoD constraints can be enforced by disallowing the process to reach certain markings, with the constraints being written as linear inequalities. Then, we design supervisors to enforce SoDs in an off-line and a real-time manner, respectively, based on the linear inequalities. Meanwhile, inequality analysis is provided for the structural simplicity of supervisors.

The proposed approach leverages the Workflow-Driven Security Framework (WDSF) to enforce the least privilege principle; to ensure workflow integrity and separation of duties, (i.e., business process enforcement and compliance); to protect the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information; and to provide traceability and non-repudiation in case of root-cause analysis.

Kubernetes, a cluster-based distributed application platform, is often used to implement this pattern. While the abstract concept is fairly well understood, CI/CD implementations vary widely. Resources are scattered across on-premise and cloud-based services, and systems may not be fully automated. Additionally, while a development pipeline may aim to ensure the security of the finished artifact, said artifact may not be protected from outside observers or cloud providers during execution. This paper describes a complete CI/CD pipeline running on Kubernetes that addresses four gaps in existing implementations. First, the pipeline supports strong separation-of-duties, partitioning development, security, and operations (i.e., DevSecOps) roles. Second, automation reduces the need for a human interface. Third, resources are scoped to a Kubernetes cluster for portability across environments (e.g., public cloud providers).

Current methods solve the conflicts in a centralized way by withdrawing or removing all crossdomain relationships resulting in the violations with the knowledge of all domains. However, these methods are inappropriate for large-scale systems due to their high computational complexity. In this article, we propose a distributed approach to avoid secure conflicts in a multidomain environment. We first model the role inheritance hierarchies of multiple domains as an interoperation graph. We then develop RIVs and SoDVs avoidance algorithms based on the interoperation graph and the communications among different domains. Each domain can execute the algorithms autonomously and in real time by evaluating whether its succeeding activated role can result in RIVs and SoDVs.

However, while reorganizing tasks for newer employees, it should be ensured that the employees have the requisite capabilities of handling the assigned tasks. Furthermore, security constraints forbid any arbitrary assignment of tasks to employees and also enforce major dependencies on other employees who have access to the same tasks. Since Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is poised to emerge as the de facto model for specifying access control policies in commercial information systems, we consider organizational policies and constraints to be modeled with ABAC. Given the increasing size and scale of organizations, both in terms of employees and resources that need to be managed, it is crucial that computational solutions are developed to automate the process of employee to task assignment. In this work, we define the Employee Replacement Problem (ERP) which answers the question of whether a given set of employees can be replaced by a smaller set of employees, while ensuring that the desired security constraints are not violated.

However, the existence of constraints (and authorization policies) may mean that a user is unable to fulfill her/his organizational duties because access to resources has been denied. In short, there is a tension between the need to protect resources (using policies and constraints) and the availability of resources. Recent work on workflow satisfiability and resiliency in access control asks whether this tension compromises the ability of an organization to achieve its objectives. In this paper, we develop a new method of specifying constraints which subsumes much related work and allows a wider range of constraints to be specified. The use of such constraints leads naturally to a range of questions related to “policy existence”, where a positive answer means that an organization's objectives can be realized. We analyze the complexity of these policy existence questions and, for particular sub-classes of constraints defined by our language, develop fixed-parameter tractable algorithms to solve them.11.An extended abstract of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the Seventh ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy [1].

Organisations generally use web enabled remote access coupled with applications access distributed on the various networks facing various challenges including increase operation burden, monitoring issues due to the dynamic and complex nature of security policies for access control. The increasingly dynamic nature of collaborations means that in one context a user should have access to sensitive information and not applicable for another context. The current access control models are static and lack of Dynamic Segregation of Duties (SoD), Task instance level of Segregation and decision making in real time. This paper addresses the limitations and supports access management in borderless network environment with dynamic SoD capability at real time access control decision making and policy enforcement. This research makes three contributions: i) Defining an Authorising Workflow Task Role Based Access Control using the existing task and workflow concepts. It integrates the dynamic SoD considering the task instance restriction to ensure overall access governance and accountability. It enhances the existing access control models such as RBAC by dynamically granting users access right and providing Access governance. ii) Extended the OASIS standard of XACML policy language to support the dynamic access control requirements and enforce the access control rules for real time decision making to mitigate risk relating to access control such as escalation of privilege in broken access control and insufficient logging and monitoring iii) The model is implemented using open source Balana policy engine to demonstrate its applicability to a real industrial use case from a financial institution.

An outsourced infrastructure is a virtual infrastructure that mimics the physical infrastructure of the precloud era; it is therefore referred to as a tenant network (TN) in this paper. This practice draws upon the notion of TN abstraction, which specifies how TNs should be managed. However, current virtual software-defined network (SDN) technology uses an SDN hypervisor to attain TNs, where the cloud administrator is given much-more-than-necessary privileges; thus, not only could violation of the security principle of least privilege occur, but the threat of a malicious or innocent-but-compromised administrator may be present. Motivated by this need, we propose the specification of TN abstraction, including its functions and security requirements. Then, we present a platform-independent concretization of this abstraction called TNGuard, which is an SDN-based architecture that protects the TNs while removing unnecessary privileges from the cloud administrator. In order to show that TNGuard concretizes the TN abstraction, we present an instantiation of TNGuard on the Xen virtualization platform with the Ryu controller. Experimental results show that the resulting system is practical, incurring a small performance overhead.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2801317","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2014CB340600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602200); Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20170413114215614); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:HUST2016YXMS087); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8279438","Internet of Things (IoT);least privilege;separation of duty;software-defined network (SDN);tenant network (TN)","Cloud computing;Security;Internet of Things;Electronic mail;Computer architecture;Virtualization;Wireless sensor networks","cloud computing;computer network security;Internet of Things;software defined networking;virtualisation","TN abstraction;SDN hypervisor;cloud administrator;much-more-than-necessary privileges;security principle;malicious compromised administrator;innocent-but-compromised administrator;security requirements;platform-independent concretization;TNGuard;Xen virtualization platform;outsourced infrastructure;virtual infrastructure;virtual software;Internet of Things network;IoT oriented tenant networks;infrastructure-as-a-service cloud computing;virtual software-defined network","","3","","51","IEEE","2 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of the existing solutions address only some of the challenges, while they impose high overhead on both the data owner and users. Though, policy management in the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model is easier and more efficient due to the existence of role hierarchical structure and role inheritance; most of the existing solutions address only enforcement of policies in form of access control matrix. In this paper, we propose an approach to enforce RBAC policies on encrypted data outsourced to service provider (SP). We utilize Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for key management and role/permission assignment. Efficient user revocation, support of role hierarchical structure updates, availability of authorized resources for users of newly added roles, and enforcement of write access control policies as well as static separation of duties (SSD), are of the proposed solution advantages.

Method: We have mapped the two separation of duties access control resources from RBAC (static and dynamic) according with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) documentation into a representative process flow using Petri Net formalism. The test scenario included two different physician roles with access permission grants labeled as in conflict if used altogether. Then, we have implemented this flow into a Colored Petri Net simulator (CPN Tools) in order to check RBAC SoD capability to address ISO 14441 privacy requirements to segregate conflicted grants from authenticated users on a general EHR system. The simulations considered conflicts either from a single user or from two users accessing shared patient's private EHR. Conclusion: Colored tokens on Petri Nets models simulating RBAC authorization are useful to demonstrate security policy conflicts during access control authorization process.

IRBAC (Interoperable Role-based Access Control) 2000 model has been proposed to achieve security interoperation between two or more RBAC administrative domains. Static Separation of Duties (SSoD) is an important security policy in RBAC, but it has not been enforced in the IRBAC 2000 model. As a result, some previous works have studied the problem of SMER (Statically Mutually Exclusive Roles) constraints violation between two RBAC domains in the IRBAC 2000 model. However all of them do not enforce how to preserve privacy of RBAC policies, such as roles, roles hierarchies and user-role assignment while detecting SMER constraints violation, if the two interoperable domains do not want to disclose them each other and to others. In order to enforce privacy-preserving detection of SMER constraints violation, we first introduce a solution without privacy-preserving mechanism using matrix product. Then a privacy-preserving solution is proposed to securely detect SMER constraints violation without disclosing any RBAC policy based on a secure three-party protocol to matrix product computation. By efficiency analysis and experimental results comparison, the secure three-party computation protocol to matrix product based on the Paillier cryptosystem is more efficient and practical.","2324-9013","978-1-5090-4906-6","10.1109/Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS.2017.277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029480","privacy-preserving;secure multi-party computation;matrix product;homomorphic cryptosystem;statically mutually exclusive roles","Protocols;Computational modeling;Privacy;Access control;Encryption","authorisation;cryptography;data protection;matrix algebra","privacy-preserving detection;statically mutually exclusive roles constraint violation;interoperable role-based access control;IRBAC 2000 model;shared data protection;security interoperation;RBAC administrative domains;static separation of duties;SSoD;SMER constraint violation;role hierarchies;user-role assignment;secure three-party protocol;matrix product computation;Paillier cryptosystem","","3","","30","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is due to the lack of means at present to express SoD constraints in MAC. The primary objective of this paper is to overcome this but within a framework that allows for rigour and linguistic features to express SoD constraints, while retaining the core security properties of BLP, namely the Simple Security Property and $\bigstar $-Property. To this end, we propose a formal framework which bridges the BLP model with the more general hierarchical role-based access control (RBAC) model. Our framework is based on a hierarchy of permissions that is founded on a novel concept of permission capacity, determined on the basis of the security levels that characterize objects in MLS models. Such a hierarchy naturally provides a solid basis for defining role seniority and deriving a hierarchical ordering on roles within MLS models. SoD constraints are expressed by means of conflicting permissions that give rise to mutually exclusive roles.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxv060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8213098","mandatory access control;multi-level security models;Bell-LaPadula security model;role-based access control","","","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

There are different models that depict the responsibility of cloud providers and customers for securing the cloud computing environments based on different service models. To the best of our knowledge, despite there are various security standards and segregation of duty models, in most cases binding of security controls to use at each layers of the model is not specified. This problem leads to some ambiguities in how to use the existing security controls in different layers. In this paper, we will combine security standards and segregation of duty models of cloud computing to introduce a reference model and useful guidelines for securing the cloud computing environments. The proposed security reference model considers both the security requirements and controls in each service models and, for all cloud layers. Also, it separates the security responsibilities of cloud provider and cloud customer to manage security controls. Since this paper is concerned primarily all aspects of security requirements, it can be directly useful to individuals who want to provide or use the cloud computing environments.","","978-1-5090-3435-2","10.1109/ISTEL.2016.7881792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881792","Cloud computing;Security requirements;Security considerations;Security standards;Security controls;Security risks","Cloud computing;Security;Computational modeling;ISO Standards;NIST;IEC Standards","cloud computing;formal specification;security of data;standards","cloud computing requirements;security standards;duty models;security reference model;security requirements;service models","","3","","35","IEEE","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Owing to loosely-coupled nature of such collaborations, access request from a remote user is made in the form of a set of permissions. The cloud vendor maps the requested permissions into appropriate local roles in order to allow resource access. However, coexistence of such multiple simultaneous role activation requests may introduce conflicts which violate the principle of security. In this paper, we propose a distributed secure collaboration framework which enables collaborating domains to detect and remove these conflicts. Two features of our framework are: (i) it requires only local information, and (ii) it detects and removes conflicts on-the-fly.

Considering economic benefits offered by this paradigm, organisations could outsource data storage and computational services. However, data in the cloud environment is within easy reach of service providers. One of the strong obstacles in widespread adoption of the cloud is to preserve confidentiality of the data. Generally, confidentiality of the data could be guaranteed by employing existing encryption schemes. For regulating access to the data, organisations require access control mechanisms. Unfortunately, access policies in clear text might leak information about the data they aim to protect. The major research challenge is to enforce dynamic access policies at runtime, i.e., Enforcement of dynamic security constraints (including dynamic separation of duties and Chinese wall) in the cloud. The main challenge lies in the fact that dynamic security constraints require notion of sessions for managing access histories that might leak information about the sensitive data if they are available as clear text in the cloud. In this paper, we present E-GRANT: an architecture able to enforce dynamic security constraints without relying on a trusted infrastructure, which can be deployed as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). In E-GRANT, sessions' access histories are encrypted in such a way that enforcement of constraints is still possible. As a proof-of-concept, we have implemented a prototype and provide a preliminary performance analysis showing a limited overhead, thus confirming the feasibility of our approach.","","978-1-4673-8103-1","10.1109/FiCloud.2015.43","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7300810","Secure Cloud Services;Sensitive Dynamic Constraints;Encrypted Dynamic Separation of Duties;Encrypted Chinese Wall;SaaS Enforcement Mechanism","Encryption;Servers;History;Google;Software as a service","cloud computing;computer centres;cryptography;outsourcing;trusted computing","E-GRANT;encrypted dynamic security constraints;cloud computing;enterprises;outsource data centres;economic benefits;cloud environment;trusted infrastructure;software-as-a-service;SaaS","","2","","34","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the recent times, ontology based access control is introduced for various domain of interest. The main purpose of this paper is representing inter-domain access permissions of multiple domain environments using ontology which is the formal and explicit representation of a domain of interest through their concepts and their associations. To attain this objective, we propose a procedure to transform the access permission matrix of multiple domain environments into inter-domain access control ontology.

Cloud systems being prone to attacks, there is a need of cyber forensic mechanisms. Traditional digital forensics models and solutions cannot be applied directly in cloud platform due to its distinct features such as multi tenancy, virtualization, rapid elasticity and the segregation of duties among cloud actors. Several technical challenges under variability of architecture, data collection, analysis and anti-forensics exist in cloud forensics. In this paper, firstly a cloud forensic clustering model is proposed across multiple virtual machine instances. Every virtual machine constitutes a virtual machine disk and its corresponding RAM image. This forensic clustering solution reduces the search space, enables multi drive correlation and forms a social network of virtual machine instances. Secondly addressing variability of cloud architectures, open source cloud platforms OpenNebula and OpenStack are compared with respect to location of evidence artifacts. An acquisition approach with the pre-processing engine to handle different architectures is designed and implemented.","","978-1-4799-8792-4","10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275641","Virtual machines;Cloud Forensics;Cloud computing;Digital Forensics;Forensic clustering;OpenStack;OpenNebula","Forensics;Virtual machining;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Random access memory;Correlation","cloud computing;data acquisition;digital forensics;pattern clustering;virtual machines","evidence preprocessing;cloud components;forensic analysis;business organizations;cloud computing;cyber forensic mechanisms;digital forensics;cloud forensics;virtual machine instances;cloud forensic clustering model;virtual machine disk;RAM image;OpenNebula platform;OpenStack platform;acquisition approach","","1","","13","IEEE","28 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The strength of RBAC is considered due to the incorporation of concept of roles. Separation of Duty (SOD) is a constraint that implements least privilege principle in RBAC. Dynamic Separation of Duty (DSD) is a powerful constraint to control internal security threats. Current RBAC standard implements DSD on the level of roles. This creates various problems. In this paper, various problems in case of implementing DSD on the level of roles are identified. We show and prove that RBAC's strength is the incorporation of concept of roles but this is not for better security in terms of authorization. Instead this helps in better administration or usability for users. The RBAC usability can be improved if RBAC administration is being implemented on the basis of roles and access control can be more secure if DSD is being implemented on the basis of conflicting permissions. The concept of normalized roles is also introduced. The proposed model implements access control on the basis of normalized role. DSD is being implemented on the basis of conflicting permissions and non-conflicting permissions are exercised under the umbrella of role. This becomes a hybrid approach for access control. The administrators are given freedom in implementing DSD in various modes according to the organizational requirements from lenient to strict implementation. The proposed model is also formally specified and the benefits as a result of implementing the proposed model are discussed.","","978-1-4799-5255-7","10.1109/ICSPCS.2014.7021054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7021054","RBAC;SOD;DSD","Permission;Standards;Usability;Business;Authorization","authorisation","permission based implementation;dynamic separation of duty;role based access control;SOD;internal security threats;RBAC standard;DSD;authorization;RBAC usability;RBAC administration;organizational requirements","","8","","20","IEEE","26 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It achieves this in part through a high level of organization and interoperability borne through the use of the continental staffing system by the U.S. and many of its NATO allies. This system is meant to separate functions and facilitate efficient flow of information to those who need to make command decisions. While it has proven effective in prior conflicts, it has become outmoded in the information age, instead stifling necessary coordination and collaboration through isolation and insulation between roles. This paper contends that the constructs used by the continental staffing system, like that of area of operation, and rigid segregation of duty through tradition, expose a seam in the system which leads to unanticipated and negative consequences on friendly forces referred to as “cyber fratricide.” Cyber Fratricide may be considered the unintentional impedance or interference between operational/tactical elements of friendly forces in the cyber realm involving the compromise or liquidation of assets, information, or capabilities of those forces. This is especially important when considering active or transactional hostilities by multiple actors. This is especially true in the case of shooting back in cyber space or active defence. By observing the most common possible forms of cyber fratricide and their enabling factors, conclusions may be drawn on possible mitigations through technical controls and reengineering of the continental staffing system to reduce cyber fratricide in active defence.

Further, this paper presents an optimal authorization method, which is optimal in the sense that it can minimize a workflow's delay caused by the temporal constraints.

Cryptographic access control (CAC), on the other hand, is an implementation paradigm intended to enforce AC policies cryptographically. CAC-methods are also attractive in military cloud and tactical environments due to their distributed and offline nature of operation. Combining the capabilities of both RBAC and CAC fully seems elusive, though. This paper studies the feasibility of implementing RBAC with respect to read-rights using a recent type of cryptographic schemes called attribute-based encryption (ABE). We present an implementation model based on the Extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) reference architecture and evaluate how the current state ABE can realize the different RBAC standard model components.

More recently, the need for risk awareness in access control has received considerable attention in the research community in light of issues such as insider threats. Although RBAC facilitates risk mitigation via features such as constraints (e.g. static and dynamic separation of duty), a quantified approach of risk awareness/mitigation has emerged as a promising research theme due to its inherent flexibility. In this approach, risk/cost metrics are computed for various entities involved in access control such as users and objects and a risk threshold limits the permissions that can be exercised. The quantified approach accommodates dynamism in access decisions based on contexts/situations such as an employee accessing a sensitive file using a work computer versus accessing using her own device. In this paper, we analyze the difference between the traditional constraint-based risk mitigation and the recent quantified risk-aware approaches in RBAC and propose a framework for introducing risk-awareness in RBAC models that incorporates quantified-risk. We also provide a formal specification of an adaptive risk-aware RBAC model by enhancing the NIST core RBAC model.","","978-1-4799-0895-0","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682761","Access Control;Policy;RBAC;Risk","Access control;Adaptation models;Estimation;NIST;Monitoring;Automation","authorisation;risk management;telecommunication security","risk-aware role;role based access control;risk mitigation;risk/cost metrics;risk threshold limits;quantified approach;work computer;risk-aware approaches;RBAC models;formal specification;NIST core RBAC model","","19","2","24","IEEE","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes a research aimed at investigating a meta-network modeling approach to analyze access vulnerabilities that could be mitigated by the application of three access control principles mentioned above.

As such, there has been little discussion on the tasks of capturing, storing, extracting, and utilizing necessary historical information. Since this information is often in the form of system events history, provenance data is naturally suitable as the source for DSOD-related information. Recently the notion of provenance-based access control (PBAC) has been formulated and a base PBAC model (PBACB) together with an underlying provenance data model has been formally specified [19], [22]. Unlike Role-based Access Control where DSOD is modeled as a constraint, PBACB directly maintains and utilizes the necessary information for DSOD enforcement. In this paper, we propose an enhanced model, PBACc, by extending both the provenance data model and the PBACB model to enforce various DSOD policy classes identified in the literature, and go beyond these to specify novel DSOD policy classes.

In this paper we are implementing Role Based access Control (RBAC) for University domain using Ontology. Roles are implemented in the form of classes having permissions associated with them, in turn making the process of administration and management of access control easy. Two step accesses are provided, first is Authentication and second is Authorization.","","978-1-4673-4603-0","10.1109/ISCO.2013.6481195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6481195","Discretionary Access Control (DAC);Mandatory Access Control (MAC);Role Based Access Control (RBAC);Ontology;Roles;Permissions;Static Separation of Duty (SSoD)","Laboratories;Ontologies","authorisation;educational computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","authentication;authorization;domain specific role based access control;ontology;access control technology;secure access;authorized access;sensitive data;sensitive resource;discretionary access control;DAC;mandatory access control;MAC;RBAC;privilege administration;privilege management;University domain;access control management","","1","1","16","IEEE","21 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A framework for analyzing the assimilation of Access Control Systems (ACS), a special type of compliance software, is developed and used to reflect the experiences obtained in four in-depth case studies. One result is that coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures significantly effect ACS assimilation. On the other hand, quality aspects have only a moderate impact at the beginning of the assimilation process, in later phases the impact may increase if performance and improvement objectives become more relevant.

Anomalous requests are processed by the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The intrusion response component is the major responsible component in IDS for anomalous requests processing. Response component manages some of the policy for authenticating the user requests for further access. The system is proposed with the Database Response Policies with two issues Policy Matching and Policy Administration. This system is termed as Joint Threshold Administrative Module (JTAM). The principle used in JTAM is Separation of Duty. The major idea is used to prevent the malicious modification of the policies by database administrators (DBA's). The database modification proposed ought to be signed by k DBA's for complete modified policy. Cryptographic algorithms are used to encrypt the policy and the signatures. The policies are limited for the user's view and for this `pattern concept' is used. An Intrusion Prevention Protocol (IPP) is proposed which detects the users that attacks the system and revokes the access rights of that user.","","978-1-84919-797-7","10.1049/cp.2012.2255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6719161","Intrusion Detection;Response;Policy;Separation of Duty;Threshold signature;Protocol;Cryptographic Algorithm","","cryptographic protocols;relational databases","relational databases;response patterns;preventive approach;database hacking;database community;intrusion detection system;IDS;intrusion response component;database response policies;policy administration;policy matching;joint threshold administrative module;JTAM;database administrators;DBA;cryptographic algorithms;intrusion prevention protocol;IPP","","","","","","23 Jan 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

To manage patient data in CCR, security as governed by HTPAA must be attained when using XML and its technologies (XACML, XSLT, etc.). Our objective is to have an XML document (CCR instance) appear differently to authorized users at different times based on a user's role, constraints, separation of duty, delegation of authority, etc. In this paper, we propose a security framework that targets XML schémas and documents, in general, and CCR schémas and documents, in particular with control capabilities that achieve customizable access to an XML document's elements by applying secure software engineering methodologies and defining new UML XML-focused diagrams for schémas and permissions. This allows us to generate XACML policies, and enforce security at the runtime level on XML instances to insure that correct and required patient data is securely delivered. In a market of rapidly emerging mobile healthcare applications to allow patients to manage their own data (PHRs) and for self-management of chronic diseases, the need for secure access to information and its authorization and transmission to providers (and EHRs) will be critical.","","978-1-4673-2747-3","10.1109/BIBMW.2012.6470239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470239","XML schemas;role-based access control;continuity of care record;security policies and enforcement","XML;Unified modeling language;Medical services;Access control;Software engineering;Standards","diseases;health care;medical information systems;mobile computing;patient diagnosis;security of data;software engineering;XML","security framework;XML schemas;XML documents;healthcare;extensible markup language;health information exchange;continuity of care record;CCR;patient data storage;patient data management;patient diagnosis;medical notes;Health IT products;electronic health record;EHR;personal health record;PHR;HTPAA;CCR schémas;CCR documents;software engineering methodologies;UML XML-focused diagrams;XACML policies;mobile healthcare applications;chronic disease self-management","","14","","38","IEEE","25 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such extensions can incorporate contextual features, such as location, into the policy decision in an attempt to restrict access to trustworthy settings. In many cases, though, such extensions fail to reflect the true threat, which is the presence or absence of other users, rather than absolute locations. For instance, for location-aware separation of duty, it is more important to ensure that two people are in the same room, rather than in a designated, pre-defined location. Prox-RBAC was proposed as an extension to consider the relative proximity of other users with the help of a pervasive monitoring infrastructure. However, that work offered only an informal view of proximity, and unnecessarily restricted the domain to spatial concerns. In this work, we present a more rigorous definition of proximity based on formal topological relations. In addition, we show that this definition can be applied to several additional domains, such as social networks, communication channels, attributes, and time; thus, our policy model and language is more flexible and powerful than the previous work. In addition to proposing the model, we present a number of theoretical results for such systems, including a complexity analysis, templates for cryptographic protocols, and proofs of security features.","","978-1-4673-2740-4","10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2012.250453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450887","access control;security;mobility;context awareness","","authorisation;cryptographic protocols","formal proximity model;RBAC system;information leakage;pervasive access;popular role based access control model;contextual features;policy decision;location aware separation;pervasive monitoring infrastructure;formal topological relation;social networks;communication channels;policy model;language;complexity analysis;templates;cryptographic protocols;security features","","1","1","20","","7 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Proxy digital scheme does not provide control over whether the proxy signer is allowed to accept delegation concerning the separation of duties, neither does it treat other possible delegation constraints. With proxy signature it is particularly important to prove whether the delegator is the authorized signer. The delegation of signature is constructed using the advantage of the RBAC model which is widely adopted in the current workflow management systems.

The Tam ago platform provides tools for static verifications of these contracts, generation of test scenarios from the abstract contracts and monitoring facilities for dynamic analyses. We have extended the platform to take into account AC aspects.

One is how provenance data can be used to enhance security in the system and the other is how to protect provenance data which might be more sensitive than the data itself. Recent data provenance-related access control literature mainly focuses on the latter issue of protecting provenance data. In this paper, we propose a novel provenance-based access control model that addresses the former objective. Using provenance data for access control to the underlying data facilitates additional capabilities beyond those available in traditional access control models. We utilize a notion of dependency as the key foundation for access control policy specification. Dependency-based policy provides simplicity and effectiveness in policy specification and access control administration. We show our model can support dynamic separation of duty, workflow control, origin-based control, and object versioning. The proposed model identifies essential components and concepts and provides a foundational base model for provenance-based access control.

Among the many solutions proposed, the Boolean matrix decomposition (BMD) formulation has stood out, which essentially discovers roles by decomposing the binary matrix representing user-to-permission assignment (UPA) into two matrices-user-to-role assignment (UA) and permission-to-role assignment (PA). However, supporting certain embedded constraints, such as separation of duty (SoD) and exceptions, is critical to the role mining process. Otherwise, the mined roles may not capture the inherent constraints of the access control policies of the organization. None of the previously proposed role mining solutions, including BMD, take into account these underlying constraints while mining. In this paper, we extend the BMD so that it reflects such embedded constraints by proposing to allow negative permissions in roles or negative role assignments for users. Specifically, by allowing negative permissions in roles, we are often able to use less roles to reconstruct the same given user-permission assignments. Moreover, from the resultant roles we can discover underlying constraints such as separation of duty constraints. This feature is not supported by any existing role mining approaches. Hence, we call the role mining problem with negative authorizations the constraint-aware role mining problem (CRM). We also explore other interesting variants of the CRM, which may occur in real situations. To enable CRM and its variants, we propose a novel approach, extended Boolean matrix decomposition (EBMD), which addresses the ineffectiveness of BMD in its ability of capturing underlying constraints. We analyze the computational complexity for each of CRM variants and present heuristics for problems that are proven to be NP-hard.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6143956","RBAC;constraint-aware role mining;EBMD.","Matrix decomposition;Authorization;Minimization;Organizations;Vectors;Clustering algorithms","authorisation;Boolean algebra;computational complexity;data mining;matrix decomposition","extended Boolean matrix decomposition;binary matrix;user-to-permission assignment;user-to-role assignment matrix;permission-to-role assignment matrix;embedded constraint;duty separation;access control policy;negative permission;negative role assignment;user-permission assignment;constraint-aware role mining problem;computational complexity;heuristics;NP-hard;role-based access control","","16","1","31","IEEE","31 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We study the problem of determining whether a SoD policy is enforceable, and show that directly enforcing SoD policies in RBAC is intractable (coNP-complete). Moreover, indirectly enforcing SoD policies by using mutually exclusive role constraints is also intractable (NP-hard). Therefore, we reduce the safety checking problem for SoD to SAT4J problem which can be solved using available SAT solvers.

But threat model in existing models is not extensive enough, so that they are vulnerable to replay attack, user forging and collusion of users as well. So they can't have secure auditing and separation of duty in a secure way. Super users and recovery agents are in trust domain and this is a security risk. These models have performance overload in some operations such as right revocation. Another problem is about keeping lots of crypto metadata in existing models. In this paper we show a new secure model for key management and access control (SeKMAC) using special concepts for optimizing number of crypto metadata and structure of metadata in system which eliminates attacks on crypto metadata with a desired degree. Key management is based on symmetric operations which causes improvement in performance. We consider parameters for avoiding reply attacks, user forging and collusion of users in insecure environments. SeKMAC includes auditing and separation of duty in a secure way and recovery is done with less trust on external agents and revocation is done in an optimum way.","","978-1-908320-00-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6148429","Access class;Crypto Metadata;Key Management Unit (KMU);Access Control Unit (ACU);Crypto Metadata Unit (CMU)","Cryptography;Access control;File systems;Authentication;Computational modeling;Data models","authorisation;cryptography;meta data","SeKMAC;key management;access control;cryptographic file system;user data protection;threat model;super users;recovery agents;trust domain;security risk;crypto metadata;symmetric operation;duty auditing;duty separation","","","1","24","","9 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the most important way for implementing SOA is the use of web services, in this paper we propose an access control model for web services to protect services and to adopt some policies on the applications using SAML and XACML standard languages. This model is defined in terms of its authentication, authorization architecture and policy formulation. Separation of duties (SoD) is a security principle that has been used extensively to prevent conflict of interest, fraud and error control in organizations. In recent years many IT organizations have struggled to identify potential SoD violations within their IT systems.

The observations that security is not an add-on feature and that insiders pose a considerable security threat have both been familiar in the security community for a long time. Attempts to deal with insider threats are not new either. Relevant techniques such as separation of duties are part of the standard toolset of security practitioners. However, it may well be true that in the past most countermeasures against insider threats belonged to the social and not to the technical domain. With increasing automation and IT support for business processes this approach is reaching its limits, as are approaches that just add-on IT security to business processes. This talk will argue that defending against insider threats is in fact just one aspect of designing secure organisational (business) processes, and that one has to start at the design of the processes within an organization to make progress in dealing with insider threat.","","978-1-4577-1908-0","10.1109/INCoS.2011.175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6132880","","Security;Communities;Collaboration;Artificial intelligence;Standards organizations;Organizations","business data processing;organisational aspects;security of data","insider threat;business process;secure-by-design;security threat;security community;add-on IT security;organisational process","","5","","","IEEE","19 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To avoid security breaches, such policies must enforce the policy constraints of the individual domains. Such constraints may include temporal constraints that limit the times when the users can access the resources, and separation of duty (SoD) constraints. Existing interoperation solutions do not address such cross-domain temporal access control and SoDs requirements. In this paper, we propose a role-based framework to facilitate secure interoperation among multiple domains by ensuring the enforcement of temporal and SoD constraints of individual domains. To support interoperation, we do not modify the internal policies, as most of the current approaches do.

Since automating business processes involves many participants, uses private and public data, and communicates with external services security becomes inevitable. In current systems, security is enforced by an access control model and supplementary constraints imposed on workflow activities. However, existing systems provide individual implementations for security policies (e.g. separation of duties) and leave out other constraints (e.g. inter-process constraints). What is missing is a systematic analysis of security policies in PAIS. Hence, in this paper, we display state of the art and provide a taxonomy of security policies in PAIS. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of research challenges and issues is presented. We will show that there are still shortcomings and identify important requirements for security in PAIS. We will also point out open questions related to specifying, modeling, and changing security policies which will provide a road map for future research.","","978-1-4577-0979-1","10.1109/ARES.2011.107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6046046","Security Policies;Process-Aware Information Systems","Unified modeling language;Guidelines;Availability;Educational institutions;Authorization","business data processing;information systems;security of data","security policy;adaptive process-aware information system;business process;access control model","","3","","19","IEEE","17 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a popular authorisation control scheme under which users are assigned to certain roles, and the roles are associated with permissions. This paper presents a novel mechanism for modelling workflow execution in cluster-based resource pools under Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) schemes. Our modelling approach uses Coloured Timed Petri-Nets, and various authorisation constraints are modelled, including role constraints, temporal constraints, cardinality constraints, Binding of Duty and Separation of Duty constraints, etc. The interactions between workflow authorisation and workflow execution are also captured in the model. In this paper, the modelling mechanism is developed in such a fashion that the construction of the authorisation model for a workflow can be automated. This feature is very helpful in modelling a large collection of authorisation policies or complex workflows. A Petri-net simulation tool, the CPN-Tool, is utilised to implement the developed modelling mechanism and simulate the constructed model. Both system-level performance (e.g., utilisation of resource pools) and application-level performance (e.g., workflow response time) can be obtained from model simulations. This work can be used to plan system capacity and investigate the impact of authorization policies on system and application performance.","","978-1-4577-0863-3","10.1109/SCC.2011.56","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6009262","Modelling;Authorisation;Workflow;RBAC","Authorization;Image color analysis;Color;Board of Directors;Data models;Analytical models;Availability","authorisation;constraint handling;graph colouring;Petri nets;workflow management software","workflow execution modelling;role-based authorisation control;cluster-based resource pools;coloured timed Petri nets;temporal constraints;cardinality constraints;duty constraints;CPN-Tool;system-level performance","","4","","27","IEEE","5 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Users with power credentials can do almost anything they want with the systems they own with very little control or oversight.

Developing a solution for such a problem is challenging because power users need flexible requirements to administer or maintain their systems. The increased usage of virtual environments, virtual systems, teleworking, and remote usage has made network access the preferred method for system administration. This paper presents (1) the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS), a framework that provides a solution to this problem and meet the above mentioned challenges, and (2) a proof-of-concept prototype that embeds self-protection capabilities into traditional Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS). AVPS focuses on self-protection against security policy violations instead of malware, vulnerability, or exploit intrusions.

We propose the notion of database response policies to support our intrusion response system tailored for a DBMS. Our interactive response policy language makes it very easy for the database administrators to specify appropriate response actions for different circumstances depending upon the nature of the anomalous request. The two main issues that we address in context of such response policies are that of policy matching, and policy administration. For the policy matching problem, we propose two algorithms that efficiently search the policy database for policies that match an anomalous request. We also extend the PostgreSQL DBMS with our policy matching mechanism, and report experimental results. The experimental evaluation shows that our techniques are very efficient. The other issue that we address is that of administration of response policies to prevent malicious modifications to policy objects from legitimate users. We propose a novel Joint Threshold Administration Model (JTAM) that is based on the principle of separation of duty. The key idea in JTAM is that a policy object is jointly administered by at least k database administrator (DBAs), that is, any modification made to a policy object will be invalid unless it has been authorized by at least k DBAs. We present design details of JTAM which is based on a cryptographic threshold signature scheme, and show how JTAM prevents malicious modifications to policy objects from authorized users. We also implement JTAM in the PostgreSQL DBMS, and report experimental results on the efficiency of our techniques.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560655","Databases;intrusion detection;response;prevention;policies;threshold signatures.","Databases;Authentication;Context;Organizations;Engines;Protocols","cryptography;digital signatures;relational databases;SQL","intrusion detection response system;relational databases;database response policies;DBMS;interactive response policy language;policy administration;policy matching problem;PostgreSQL DBMS;joint threshold administration model;cryptographic threshold signature scheme","","25","","26","IEEE","2 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are certain constraints which make the information security tight. Separation of duty (SOD) in terms of mutual exclusion and role inheritance (RI) are some of those constraints which provide security of information and make the management of security policy easy. On one side after implementing separation of duty, we may able to get tight security but on the other side it can create complexity for the security administrator and the user who uses the system. In this paper we describe the complexities and complications which can be faced after implementing separation of duty in terms of mutually exclusive roles (MER).

To enforce the separation of duty in the information systems, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) has been proposed and been the most popular access control model in today's security management. This paper focuses on the Dynamic Separation of Duty (DSD) which is one of the four components of the ANSI RBAC standard. To maximize the utilization of human resources, one user is allowed to have multiple mutually exclusive roles but can activate only one role at a time. The DSD does not only provide more flexibility for business system but also create more vulnerability in the separation of duty compliance because of the complication in checking the conflict of interest. This paper proposes a very simple but effective model to solve the problem of the DSD by integrating the workflow sequence to the concept of mutually exclusive roles (MER) constraint. From the proposed model, the conflict of interest can be verified at run time. The system will not allow the continuity of any process if the activation of conflicting users has been found.","","978-1-4244-7010-5","10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5664902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664902","Separation of duty (SoD);Role-Based Access Control (RBAC);the Constrained RBAC;Static Separation of Duty (SSD);Dynamic Separation of Duty (DSD);Mutually Exclusive Roles (MER);Workflow","Business;History;Access control;Context;ANSI standards;Information systems","authorisation;information systems","run-time enforcement model;dynamic separation of duty;information systems;fraud prevention;role-based access control;security management;ANSI RBAC standard;business system;mutually exclusive roles constraint","","2","","9","IEEE","10 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The security policy is decomposed into sub-policies based on an object domain approach so the decisions are local to the object's domain. The classes of policies investigated are dynamic history-based access control policies, ie. the PDPs decision is dependent on the history of interaction between users and system resources. This type of policy can capture static and dynamic separation of duty policies, as are commonly found in commercial organisations. The distribution model of the PDP allows for the coordination and synchronisation of PDPs on the basis of events, where a decision is based on a previous history originating from other PDPs. The key contribution of this paper is the analysis of temporal dependencies between policies and an efficient PDP distribution strategy for object-based distributed systems as well as presenting a designed library that create and synchronize a network of PDP's in a peer to peer fashion.","","978-1-4244-7548-3","10.1109/CIT.2010.189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578621","collaborative policy enforcement;decentralised policy enforcement;PDPs coordination","Synchronization;Access control;Libraries;History;Prototypes;Decision making","authorisation;distributed processing;groupware;XML","decentralized XACML overlay network;security policy;object-based distributed system;multiple PDP;object domain approach;dynamic history-based access control;collaborative policy enforcement","","4","","15","IEEE","16 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such focus on safety properties probably stems from the fact that access control has been mostly viewed as a tool for restricting access. An equally important aspect of access control is the availability properties about enabling access. One example is an availability policy, which states that the cooperation of at most a certain number of users is required to successfully complete a task. In many situations, both safety and availability properties are required in the context of access control, though conflicts may arise due to their opposite focuses. In this paper, we combine a static SoD policy and an availability policy to introduce the available static SoD (ASSoD) policies to capture both of the safety and availability properties. We present the computational complexity of the satisfy checking problem of ASSoD policies, and show that it is intractable (both coNP-complete and NPcomplete) to checking whether an access control state satisfy an ASSoD policy. We also show that not all size-2 ASSoD policy set are composable, and study the composition properties of ASSoD policies.","","978-1-4244-6598-9","10.1109/NSWCTC.2010.73","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5480680","Access Control;safety;availability;separation-ofduty","Access control;Safety;Permission;Availability;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Information technology;Computer security;Information security;National security","authorisation;computational complexity;safety-critical software","access control;separation of duty policies;availability policy;safety properties;computational complexity","","1","","11","IEEE","7 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A security policy model always develops; accordingly, the design of a security system using that policy model should reflect the changes. Using role-based access control (RBAC) as an example, currently it supports role hierarchy, static separation of duty relations, and dynamic separation of duty relations. As research on RBAC progresses, more concerns have been and will be covered. So the model hierarchy of RBAC is quickly becoming more and more complicated, which requires that the security system supporting RBAC be flexible and extensible. To address this issue at the design level, we propose an aspect-oriented approach to designing flexible and extensible security systems. This paper illustrates the approach through a case study, which is part of a design for CORBA access control (AC) supporting RBAC models.","","978-1-4244-3885-3","10.1109/IEEEGCC.2009.5734277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734277","","Unified modeling language;Object oriented modeling;Programming;Access control;Conferences;Computational modeling","aspect-oriented programming;authorisation","secure role based access control systems;aspect orientation design;extensible security systems;CORBA access control","","1","","20","IEEE","17 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of that distributed trust concepts like separation of duty for the voting servers, four eyes principle for administrators and the election commission, as well as the multiplicity of control functions like for the counting of votes cannot be demanded precisely. This article proposes to extend the evaluation of Internet voting systems by the computation of a so called k-resilience value. This value defines the robustness of a system and helps to identify vulnerabilities.

In this paper, we propose an evaluation model for business process, which considers the above two factors at the same time.

This paper considers both types of tasks involved in a Web services-based process and the corresponding access control problem. We focus on two types of access control constraints, namely separation of duties (SoD) and binding of duties (BoD). Both role-level and participant-level of SoDs and BoDs are investigated in this paper.

In this paper, an optimized RBAC model based on fuzzy theory is proposed. Bitmap matrix is used for computing role's trustworthiness(RT); Variance is applied to adjust attribute weight vector to improve max-min operation's limitation; Similar users are clustered to share group experience to improve the accuracy of the model; Historical and mutually exclusive permission table for each user is enforced to implement fuzzy RBAC model with separation of duty constraint. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized model has greater accuracy and avoids the invalidation under special conditions. Additionally, aiming at the limitation of role inheritance and constraint in traditional XML-described RBAC model, a new XML-graph method is introduced. In this method, multi-inheritance is implemented by referencing attributes and private permission is protected by private inheritance. Using XML-graph to describe the improved fuzzy RBAC model, access control strategy can be easily deployed in different systems and the model's application range is largely expanded.","","978-0-7695-3825-9","10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341567","Fuzzy;RBAC;Bitmap Matrix;clustering;separation of duty;XML-graph","Access control;Permission;Fuzzy systems;XML;Embedded computing;Security;Decision making;Protection;Fuzzy control;Helium","authorisation;decision making;fuzzy set theory;minimax techniques;XML","fuzzy RBAC model;security strategy standardization;optimized RBAC model;Bitmap matrix;max-min operation limitation improvement;historical exclusive permission table;duty constraint separation;XML graph method;multi-inheritance method;role based access control strategy;role trustworthiness;human fuzzy decision making capability","","","","12","IEEE","1 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior to concrete interoperation, one important problem is to establish role mappings. Two issues are involved in the establishing process. The first one is to generate role mappings while respecting RBAC states such as separation of duty (SoD) constraints. On the other hand, administrative works of RBAC policies are sometimes needed to generate mappings. This paper investigates these two problems, mostly from the computational perspective. In particular, we study how to find a set of roles appropriate for mappings and how to fulfill interoperation requests; it turns out that most of corresponding problems are NP-complete. Further, several useful subcases of these problems are identified. We also motivate and support partial interoperation by imposing constraints on interoperation requests. When administrative works are necessary, we examine how to minimize administrative cost; the result is that one subcase of the problem reduces to the ""minimal set cover"" (MSC) problem. We demonstrate that approaches to MSC can be applied to this problem, even though they are not totally equivalent. Finally, a discussion on how administrative operations made to RBAC states may influence interoperability is presented as well.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.76","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319036","role mappings;secure interoperation;RBAC;administration","Access control;Permission;Computer security;Concrete;Intelligent networks;Distributed computing;Educational institutions;Computer science;International collaboration;Costs","authorisation;graph theory;groupware;minimisation;open systems;set theory","inter-domain role mapping;RBAC-based secure interoperation;collaborating environment;role based access control;separation of duty constraint;SoD;NP-complete problem;administrative cost minimization;minimal set cover problem;interoperability","","8","","27","IEEE","10 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Access control policies define which users have access to what objects and operations and describe any existing constraints.

We examine the integration, not necessarily the inclusion, of these policies into business processes and consider such effects as consistency. Determining the effects of these policies can become difficult because several such policies exist, and taking into account all possible combinations or executions of these policies is tedious and error-prone. In addition, the number of policies usually increases over time and adds to the complexity of analyzing their combinations. It is acknowledged in the literature that what you specify is what you get, but that is not necessarily what you want. To show our approach, we specify certain access control policies for Resource--Event--Agent (REA) business processes and examine the addition and combination of these policies.

This approach which is based on the standard of access control RBAC, introduces new rules to detect potential conflicts related to a workflow instance and also suggests the use of the concept of priority in order to resolve these conflicts.","2161-5330","978-1-4244-3807-5","10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5069394","","Access control;Permission;Automation;Workflow management software;ANSI standards;Standards publication;Application software;Globalization;Data security","authorisation;workflow management software","access control;RB-WAC;business process;workflow management systems;separation of duties;role-based workflow access control","","5","","12","IEEE","5 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However in PBDM there is no explicit specification of the separation of duty (SOD) constraint, which is one of the most important constraints and is essential to the security of the system. In this paper, we analyze the SOD constraint in PBDM delegation model and give the formal definition for the constraint. We prove that the constraint violation will not happen at the stage of the delegation role definition whereas it can only happen at the stage of role assignment.

To prevent fraud or abuse due to conflict of interests, a well-known authorization constraint called separation of duty (SoD) is commonly applied. SoD ensures that no single user receives too many authorities. Enforcement of authorization constraints such as SoD in large organizations can be difficult due to the large number of information system users, the variety of assets involved, and tasks that require roles that may be shared or delegated at multiple levels. Most existing work in this area focuses on specifications of SoD constraints and assumes that constraints can be enforced by logical inference mechanisms at run-time. A drawback of this approach is that when violations occur, finding alternative role activations at run-time may not be feasible. This can result in delays or even failure for critical service transactions. Moreover, logic-based systems are difficult to understand and do not scale easily. This paper presents an algorithmic set-based approach that automatically checks for SoD compliance prior to run-time by searching for a set of valid role activations. The paper discusses details of this approach and illustrates its use in managing access authorizations in a health insurance claim processing system.","1062-922X","978-1-4244-2383-5","10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4811840","role-based access control;separation of duty;information security;conflict of interest;policy compliance","Authorization;Information systems;Information security;Runtime;Management information systems;Computer security;Inference mechanisms;Delay;Access control;Protection","authorisation;health care;information systems;insurance data processing;logic programming","authorization constraint enforcement;information system security;fraud prevention;separation of duty;logic-based systems;access authorizations;health insurance claim processing system","","","","11","IEEE","7 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We presents the requirement for constraint secure interoperation, prohibiting implicit authorizations that break constraints of other member domain. We propose a framework for crossdomain constraint enforcement in dynamic mediator-free ad hoc collaboration. By introducing crossdomain migration of MD-SMERs, the framework ensures the global security in terms of SMERs from individual domains. Specifically, we introduce a bitmap-based history-recording mechanism for collaborating domains to analyze the interplay among innerdomain role hierarchies, crossdomain role-role mappings, and SMER constraints.

In particular, the permissions assigned to users depend on their physical positions in a reference space. When a session is established in a spatial regionby users, some spatial constraints related to thissession will be triggered and control the session process during its life automatically. There are often multiple mutually exclusive spatial roles (MESR)constraints that can enforce the same spatial separation of duty policy (SSoD). Although the different MESR constraints can enforce the same effect on the same session, we have found that the different MESR constraints are varying greatly in the enforcement efficiency. The more precise the MESR sets are defined for enforcing an SSoD policy, the less overhead the system is suffered. In this paper, we argue that enforcement of SSoD policies is realized by specifying minimal MESR constraints. By comparing the different MESR constraints which can enforce the same SSoD, we conclude the minimal MESR constraints can avoid redundant restrictiveness effectively and enforce the SSoD policy precisely. We also present an algorithm that generates all minimal MESR constraints that are precise for enforcing oneSSoD policy.","","978-0-7695-3398-8","10.1109/ICYCS.2008.223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4709299","Location-based services;spatial region;spatial database;spatial separation of duty;mutually exclusive spatial roles","Access control;Data security;Computer science;Application software;Permission;Automatic control;Process control;Spatial databases;Database systems;Information security","authorisation;mobile computing","location-based services;security requirements;spatially aware access control systems;mutually exclusive spatial roles;spatial separation of duty policy","","","","8","IEEE","12 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) is a relatively new paradigm for protecting information systems. In the ANSI standard RBAC model both static and dynamic SoD are defined. However, static SoD policies assume that the system has full control over the assignment of all roles to users, whilst dynamic SoD policies assume that conflicts of interest can only arise during the simultaneous activation of a user's roles. Unfortunately neither of these assumptions hold true in dynamic virtual organisations (VOs), or in business processes that span multiple user sessions, or where users only partially disclose their roles at each session. In this paper we propose multi-session SoD (MSoD) policies for business processes which include multiple tasks enacted by multiple users over many user access control sessions. We explore the means to define MSoD policies in RBAC via multi-session mutually exclusive roles (MMER) and multi-session mutually exclusive privileges (MMEP). We propose an approach to expressing MSoD policies in XML and enforcing MSoD policies in a policy controlled RBAC infrastructure.

In the role-based access control(RBAC) model, separation of duty constraints enforce conflict of interest policies. There are two main types of separation of duty policies in RBAC, Static SoD (SSoD) and Dynamic SoD (DSoD). In RBAC, Statically Mutually Exclusive Role (SMER) constraints are used to enforce Static Separation of Duty policies. Dynamic Separation of duty policies, like SSoD policies, are intended to limit the permissions that are available to a user. However, DSoD policies differ from SSoD policies by the context in which these limitations are imposed. A DSoD policy limits the availability of the permissions over a users permission space by placing constraints on the roles that can be activated within or across a users sessions. Like SMER, in RBAC Dynamically Mutually Exclusive Role (DMER) constraints are used to enforce DSoD policies. We investigated using of a fuzzy approach to address the issue in order to provide a more practical solution. In this paper, we propose a model to express the separation of duty policies in RBAC using the fuzzy set theory. The concept of trustworthiness, which is fuzzy in nature, is used to express this model. In comparison with non-fuzzy methods, our method is more pragmatic and more consistent with the real world. The expressiveness of our method is higher than the non- fuzzy ones. We show expression of some constraints in our method which cannot be expressed by non-fuzzy methods.

In this paper, we introduce two novel authorization constraint specification schemes named as prohibition constraint scheme and obligation constraint scheme. Both of them can be used for expressing and enforcing authorization constraints. These schemes strongly bind to authorization entity set functions and authorization entity relation functions, so they can provide the system designers a clear view about which functions should be defined in an authorization constraint system. Based on these functions, different kinds of constraint schemes can be easily defined. The security administrators can use these functions to create constraint schemes for their day-to-day operations. The constraint system can be scalable through defining new functions. This approach goes beyond the well known separation of duty constraints, and considers many aspects of entity relation constraints.","","0-7695-2876-7","10.1109/IAS.2007.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299761","Access control;authorization constraints;constraints specification;constraints enforcement","Authorization;Access control;Permission;Context modeling;Information security;Knowledge based systems;Visualization;Computer security;Data security","authorisation;formal specification","function-based authorization constraint specification;function-based authorization constraint enforcement;role-based access control;prohibition constraint scheme;obligation constraint scheme;authorization entity set functions;authorization entity relation functions;security administrators","","","","17","IEEE","10 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key advantage of our approach is that past histories of service invocations can be used to make access control decisions. Our approach allows role hierarchies and separation of duty constraints. Access controls rules may be parameterized by one or more arguments. We have implemented our access control model via a declarative policy specification language which uses pure-past linear temporal logic (PPLTL).

It also allows administrators to define dynamic policies based on access history and the environment, e.g., time of day. FRAC introduces a virtual control namespace (VCN) that provides an interface to query and update the state of the access control framework over the standard file system protocol. This namespace eliminates the need for executing specialized user agents either at the client or at the server. Therefore, FRAC does not require any modification to either the file system client or the file server. We have implemented FRAC for the widely deployed NFS protocol using FileWall, a file system proxy previously developed by us.

Such privileges can circumvent certain security checks but should be used in a controlled manner. This paper proposes a privilege control policy called DMPC (dynamically modified privilege control). It has two components: a hybrid privilege control model and a new POSIX (portable operating system interface) capability inheritance algorithm. The privilege control model in DMPC is a combination of role based access control (RBAC), domain and type enforcement (DTE) and POSIX capability mechanism while the capability inheritance algorithm serves as an engine to effectively enforce the hybrid privilege control model on a secure operating system. The DMPC's design has given a high priority to supporting least privilege to a finer level of granularity on trusted systems. Additional (sub-) goals for the DMPC policy are: realizing separation of duties among privileged users, achieving separation of trusted functions from untrusted ones and providing a flexible and dynamically mediated capability mechanism. We show that RBAC alone is insufficient to enforce the principle of least privilege in a dynamic context, and that DTE and POSIX capability mechanism can successfully be conjugated with RBAC for this purpose. We also describe an implementation of the DMPC policy on a real system and report on experimental results","","1-4244-0130-5","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652115","","Operating systems;Access control;Control systems;Helium;Process control;Engines;Computer security;Linux;Electronic mail;Availability","application program interfaces;authorisation;Unix","dynamically modified privilege control policy;portable operating system interface;role based access control;trusted systems;security checks","","","1","16","IEEE","10 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But despite its elegance and effectiveness, CBD has inherent limitations that restrict its applicability. These limitations include, among others: lack of support for non-monotonic policies, such as separation of duties; the inability to support the transfer of privileges, where the delegator loses the privilege it delegates; and the lack of support for quotas, i.e., restrictions on the number of time a given privilege can be exercised. This paper describes an approach to the distributed delegation, which shares much of the flexibility and scalability of CBD, but is not encumbered by its limitations. This approach is based on the decentralized control mechanism called law-governed interaction (LGI), which is used to regulate the process of delegation itself.","","0-7695-2598-9","10.1109/POLICY.2006.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631175","","Scalability;Authorization;Computer science;Access control;Distributed control;Project management;Logic;Public key;Process control;Conferences","authorisation;distributed processing","regulated delegation;distributed systems;certificate-based delegation;distributed access control;nonmonotonic policies;distributed delegation;decentralized control;law-governed interaction","","2","","10","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Higher-level policy languages allow policy administrators to demarcate themselves from implementation details, thus focusing on business rule definition. More specifically, history-based policies allow the specification of rules based on events that occurred in the past, such as separation-of-duty related rules (e.g. an employee cannot both issue a voucher and approve the payment). Several policy engines already support history-based semantics. However, they either provide limited expressiveness in policy rules or they neglect critical scalability issues. Individual policy definitions are disregarded in storage and lookup implementations, thus ignoring the potential for important performance optimizations. Furthermore, purging meta-policy semantics are not provided, inducing the growth of the past event repository until policy evaluation becomes unmanageable. We present an extension to the Heimdall system, a history-enabled policy engine which allows the definition, enforcement and auditing of history-based policies. This extension targets the scalability of Heimdall in practical environments, introducing an evaluation optimizer and the concept of purging meta-policy tags.

This filtering approach decouples coordination and control from application implementation, allowing the coordination and control mechanism and application implementations to evolve independently of each other.

Instead of building walls around servers or hard drives, a protective layer of encryption is provided around specific sensitive data items or objects. This prevents outside attacks as well as infiltration from within the server itself. This also allows the security administrator to define which data stored in databases are sensitive and thereby focusing the protection only on the sensitive data, which in turn minimizes the delays or burdens on the system that may occur from other bulk encryption methods. Encryption can provide strong security for data at rest, but developing a database encryption strategy must take many factors into consideration. We present column-level database encryption as the only solution that is capable of protecting against external and internal threats, and at the same time meeting all regulatory requirements. We use the key concepts of security dictionary, type transparent cryptography and propose solutions on how to transparently store and search encrypted database fields. Different stored data encryption strategies are outlined, so you can decide the best practice for each situation, and each individual field in your database, to handle different security and operating requirements.

In many practical scenarios, users may be restricted to assume roles only at predefined time periods. Furthermore, roles may only be invoked on prespecified intervals of time depending upon when certain actions are permitted. To capture such dynamic aspects of a role, a temporal RBAC (TRBAC) model has been recently proposed. However, the TRBAC model addresses the role enabling constraints only. In This work, we propose a generalized temporal role-based access control (GTRBAC) model capable of expressing a wider range of temporal constraints. In particular, the model allows expressing periodic as well as duration constraints on roles, user-role assignments, and role-permission assignments. In an interval, activation of a role can further be restricted as a result of numerous activation constraints including cardinality constraints and maximum active duration constraints. The GTRBAC model extends the syntactic structure of the TRBAC model and its event and trigger expressions subsume those of TRBAC.

To solve the problem, in view of decoupling workflow access control model from workflow model, we propose a service-oriented workflow access control (SOWAC) model in this paper. In the SOWAC model, service is the abstraction of a task and the unit for applying access control. We present the elements of the SOWAC model and illustrate the enforcement of SOWAC with an example workflow.

A workflow consists of a collection of tasks that are organized to facilitate some business process specification. To simplify the complexity of security administration, it is common to use role-based access control (RBAC) to grant authorization to roles and users. Typically, security policies are expressed as constraints on users, roles, tasks and the workflow itself. A workflow system can become very complex and involve several organizations or different units of an organization, thus the number of security policies may be very large and their interactions very complex. It is clearly important to know whether the existence of such constraints will prevent certain instances of the workflow from completing. Unfortunately, no existing constraint models have considered this problem satisfactorily. In this paper, we define a model for constrained workflow systems that includes local and global cardinality constraints, separation of duty constraints and binding of duty constraints. We define the notion of a workflow specification and of a constrained workflow authorization schema. Our main result is to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the set of constraints that ensure a sound constrained workflow authorization schema, that is, for any user or any role who are authorized to a task, there is at least one complete workflow instance when this user or this role executes this task.","1063-6900","0-7695-2169-X","10.1109/CSFW.2004.1310739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310739","","Authorization;Workflow management software;Access control;Computer science;Information security;Business process re-engineering;Sufficient conditions;Automation;History;Permission","authorisation;computational complexity;workflow management software;constraint handling;formal specification","task-based authorization constraints;workflow system constraints;workflow management systems;business process specification;security administration complexity;role-based access control;security policies;constraint model;cardinality constraints;duty constraints;workflow specification;workflow authorization","","10","","18","IEEE","12 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present Cassandra, a role-based trust management system with an elegant and readable policy specification language based on Datalog with constraints. The expressiveness (and computational complexity) of the language can be adjusted by choosing an appropriate constraint domain. With just five special predicates, we can easily express a wide range of policies including role hierarchy, role delegation, separation of duties, cascading revocation, automatic credential discovery and trust negotiation.

Web services are based on a set of XML standards such as simple object access protocol (SOAP), universal description discovery and integration (UDDI) and Web services description language (WSDL). Web services architectures are built on an insecure, unmonitored and shared environment, which is open to events such as security threats. Security concerns are the major barrier that prevents many business organizations from implementing or employing Web services. Based on the previous research in conflict of interest (CIR), this paper further introduces another important security concept called separation of duties (SoD) for Web services matchmaking process (WSMP). Next, this paper discusses the relationships between CIR and SoD in the context of matchmaking process. The paper then extends these two concepts into specifying and implementing CIR and SoD assertions in the newly developed WS-policy. WS-policy is an XML representation that provides a grammar for expressing Web services policies, to allow service locators to have a common interpretation of security requirements in the matchmaking process. Further, this paper presents a matchmaking algorithm for maximizing the level of SoD. Lastly, this paper also describes a prototype framework with ""CIRService"" and ""SoDService"" services for supporting CIR and SoD assertions in matchmaking process.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265212","","Web services;Security;XML;Simple object access protocol;Logic;Web and internet services;Organizational aspects;Australia;Service oriented architecture;Prototypes","security of data;Internet;XML","WS-policy;separation of duties;Web services matchmaking process;conflict of interest;XML representation;grammar;Web services policy;security requirement;matchmaking algorithm;CIRService;SoDService","","2","2","29","IEEE","26 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It enables a better understanding of the security problems in an institution because it bridges the gap between their technical aspects and their managerial descriptions. Several models have been devised to describe RBAC. However, the definitions of some of the concepts of RBAC, such as subject, role and permission, were open to many interpretations. Also, the devised models for RBAC, did not detail the analysis of the access operations in RBAC. We formalize each of the basic concepts of RBAC for their definitions to be clear and precise. Based on these definitions, a formal state-based model for flat role based access control (FRBAC) is constructed and described in the specification notation Z. This approach permits the close examination of the states in the system. Consequently, it helps to analyse in depth the access operations of RBAC. The model is also refined by supporting the concepts of active roles and private permissions. In the future, the model can be enhanced by extending it to model the delegation and revocation of roles. Other developments of this model include the support of the separation of duty constraints.","","0-7803-7983-7","10.1109/AICCSA.2003.1227507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1227507","","Access control;Security;Permission;Bridges;Authorization","authorisation;specification languages;formal specification","flat role-based access control;FRBAC;security problems;formal state-based model;Z specification notation;private permissions;duty constraint separation;authorisation","","5","","","IEEE","8 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This model regulates user's access to EPR based on organizational roles. It supports a role-tree hierarchy with authorization inheritance; positive and negative authorizations; static and dynamic separation of duties based on weak and strong role conflicts. Contextual authorizations use environmental information available at access time, like user/patient relationship, in order to decide whether a user is allowed to access an EPR resource.

A series of simple examples is used to demonstrate that existing integrity mechanisms such as separation of duties, well-formed transactions, and so forth, can be regarded as implementation techniques for achieving integrity. The proposed characterization of integrity is nonfunctional, that is, it falls into the same category of properties as noninterference and its relatives.

This objective is achieved by disseminating the tasks and associated privileges for a specific business process among multiple users. This principle is demonstrated in the traditional example of separation of duty found in the requirement of two signatures on a check. Previous work on separation of duty requirements often explored implementations based on role-based access control (RBAC) principles. These implementations are concerned with constraining the associations between RBAC components, namely users, roles, and permissions. Enforcement of the separation of duty requirements, although an integrity requirement, thus relies on an access control service that is sensitive to the separation of duty requirements. A distinction between separation of duty requirements that can be enforced in administrative environments, namely static separation of duty, and requirements that can only be enforced in a run-time environment, namely dynamic separation of duty, is required. It is argued that RBAC does not support the complex work processes often associated with separation of duty requirements, particularly with dynamic separation of duty. The workflow environment, being primarily concerned with the facilitation of complex work processes, provides a context in which the specification of separation of duty requirements can be studied. This paper presents the “conflicting entities“ administration paradigm for the specification of static and dynamic separation of duty requirements in the workflow environment.","0018-8670","","10.1147/sj.403.0666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5386928","","","","","","118","26","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

For better performance, it is important to keep resources and information integrity from unexpected use by unauthorized users. Therefore, there is a strong demand for access control of distributed shared resources. Role-Based-Access-Control (RBAC) has been introduced and offers a powerful means for specifying access control decisions. The authors propose an object oriented RBAC model for distributed system (ORBAC), it efficiently represents the real world. Moreover, under the decentralized ORBAC management architecture, an implementation of the model has realized multiple-domain access control.

As security administrators can design and manage security policies by changing the configuration of RBAC components to meet their organization's own security needs, RBAC is called policy-neutral and has ability to articulate enterprise-specific security policies. While most researches on RBAC are for defining, describing model in formal method and other important properties such as separation of duty, little work has been done on how applications should be designed and then executed in automated information systems based on RBAC security model.

For example, the Clark-Wilson model stresses the importance of such a policy appropriate for regulating the involvement of subjects in acting upon business information and business values. However, it gives no guidelines on how to distinguish a proper policy from an improper one. Furthermore, the discipline of auditing has developed numerous schemes for segregation of duties. In this paper we use a model that allows quantification of-and reasoning about-audit-technical segregation of duties. Our approach is based on normative ('Soll') and actual ('Ist') specifications of a company's circular flow of business values in terms of enriched Petri nets. In this type of Petri net the markers represent money, goods, debts and registrations of these business values, the places represent their buffer locations and the transitions represent transformation procedures. Associated to these Petri net elements are agents and their authorisations and abilities. Undetectable use of company assets can now be modelled in the '1st' net by the general Petri net notion of 'T-invariant'. The design of a proper scheme for segregation of duties then reduces to maximisation of the number of agents that need to be minimally involved in order to establish a firing of such a T-invariant.","","0-8186-8353-8","10.1109/DEXA.1998.707411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=707411","","Authorization;Protection;Europe;Stress;Electrical capacitance tomography;Guidelines;Read only memory;Petri nets;Companies;Security","authorisation;data integrity;inference mechanisms;Petri nets","segregation of duties;Clark-Wilson model;business information;business values;quantification;reasoning;Petri nets;T-invariant;data integrity","","2","","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main features of this extension have been implemented in the Oracle RDBMS and have been adopted for a future version of the ANSI SQL standard. This study focuses on major concepts and issues, not syntax and implementation. The key idea is to allow users to group and name privileges to form named protection domains (NPDs). The Clark-Wilson (1987) and Bell-LaPadula (1973) models are used to illustrate the benefits and limitations of NPDs. The main conclusion is that the naming and abstraction mechanism provided by NPDs can simplify security management in much the same way that procedures can simplify programming.<>","","0-8186-2060-9","10.1109/RISP.1990.63844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=63844","","Data security;Information security;Application software;Computer security;Access control;ANSI standards;Information management;Spatial databases;Protection;Relational databases","DP management;query languages;relational databases;security of data;standards","privilege naming;privilege grouping;relational DBMS;Clark-Wilson model;Bell-LaPadula model;security management;large databases;ANSI SQI;access controls;administrative roles;auditor;separation of duties;Oracle;named protection domains;abstraction mechanism","","52","13","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
